    <h style="color:blue">My profile</h>
    <p style="color:brown">I am Elvis, currently living in The United States of America. I am a 32-year resient old man who think possibilities are everywhere. I come from a family of 9 members included mom and dad. Regardless of the place I am now, I love my country and things I left back like my friends and family. I am an English teacher studying a bachellor in computer science pushed by the lack of oportunities of my country to get a job. Now, to be an developer is fundamental since I found I can get more oportunities in this saturated and globalized world. People cannot be supportative sometimes but what I know and learned is enough to encourage myself to go on.</p>
